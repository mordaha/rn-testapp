# sample app with auth0 && maps

### For IOS (mac) `in terminal`:

1. Install Xcode 9 from AppStore
2. Install Homebrew [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
3. Install cocoa pods `brew install cocoapods`
4. Install Node `brew install node`
5. Install yarn `brew install yarn`
6. Install react-native-cli `npm i -g react-native-cli`
7. Clone the project for example into 'testapp' folder
8. `cd testapp`
9. Run `yarn`
10. `cd ios` run `pod install`, then `cd ..`
11. Ask me for a key, and paste it as a string into App.js L:23
12. Run `react-native run-ios`

Should work.
